# A party is a distributed ordering node, which includes:
# a router, a consenter, an assembler, and several batchers, one for each shard.
Parties:
    # PartyID uint16, id >0
  - PartyID: 1
    # The CA certs of the CA generating the party's signing key-pairs
    # Note: later this will come from the MSP, as defined in the config block, we do not support it yet
    CACerts:
      - path/to/cacert1

# Batching carries config parameters that need to be uniform across all nodes that generate and validate batches (blocks).
Batching:
  # BatchTimeouts controls the timeouts of a batch.
  BatchTimeouts:
    # BatchCreationTimeout is the time a batch can wait before it is created.
    BatchCreationTimeout: 500ms
    # FirstStrikeThreshold defines the maximum time a request can remain in the memory pool without being batched.
    # After this duration, the request is forwarded to the primary batcher by the secondary batcher.
    FirstStrikeThreshold: 10s
    # SecondStrikeThreshold defines the maximum duration that can pass following the FirstStrikeThreshold.
    # If this timeout is reached, a complaint is sent to the consensus layer, suspecting primary censorship of the request.
    SecondStrikeThreshold: 10s
    # AutoRemoveTimeout defines the maximum time a request can stay in the memory pool after the second threshold is reached.
    # If this timeout is reached, the request is removed from the pool.
    # NOTE: This timeout's intended purpose is not implemented and is used for GC by the memory pool.
    AutoRemoveTimeout: 10s
  # Batch Size: Controls the number of messages batched into a block.
  BatchSize:
    # Max Message Count: The maximum number of messages to permit in a
    # batch.  No block will contain more than this number of messages.
    MaxMessageCount: 10000

    # Absolute Max Bytes: The absolute maximum number of bytes allowed for
    # the serialized messages in a batch. The maximum block size is this value
    # plus the size of the associated metadata (usually a few KB depending
    # upon the size of the signing identities). Any transaction larger than
    # this value will be rejected by ordering.
    # It is recommended not to exceed 49 MB, given the default grpc max message size of 100 MB
    # configured on orderer and peer nodes (and allowing for message expansion during communication).
    # For example AbsoluteMaxBytes can be set to 1024 * 1024 * 10 which is 10MB and equals to 10485760.
    AbsoluteMaxBytes: 10485760

    # Preferred Max Bytes: The preferred maximum number of bytes allowed
    # for the serialized messages in a batch. Roughly, this field may be considered
    # the best effort maximum size of a batch. A batch will fill with messages
    # until this size is reached (or the max message count, or batch timeout is
    # exceeded).  If adding a new message to the batch would cause the batch to
    # exceed the preferred max bytes, then the current batch is closed and written
    # to a block, and a new batch containing the new message is created.  If a
    # message larger than the preferred max bytes is received, then its batch
    # will contain only that message.  Because messages may be larger than
    # preferred max bytes (up to AbsoluteMaxBytes), some batches may exceed
    # the preferred max bytes, but will always contain exactly one transaction.
    # *** NOTE: This field is not in use. ***
    PreferredMaxBytes: 2 MB
  # RequestMaxBytes is the maximal number of bytes allowed in a request.
  RequestMaxBytes: 1048576

  # MaxPartyID is the maximum PartyID ever used.
